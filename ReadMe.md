## Main Contributions

Face de-identification (DeID) has been extensively studied in general contexts, but the medical domain remains underexplored, largely due to privacy concerns and the scarcity of large-scale patient face datasets. This paper introduces MeMa, a dataset comprising over 40,000 photo-realistic images of patient faces. Generated from a vast collection of real patient photos, MeMa is crafted through meticulous generation and data-filtering processes that safeguard patient privacy while preserving rich and plausible medical manifestations. 

We have collaborated with expert clinicians to annotate MeMa with both coarse- and fine-grained labels, establishing it as the first benchmark for medical-scene DeID. Furthermore, we present a novel baseline approach for this specialized task, which integrates data-driven medical semantic priors into the de-identification process. Despite its simplicity, this method achieves significant performance improvements over existing techniques.

## MeMa Dataset

The MeMa dataset can be accessed at [MeMa dataset link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1lDB44q7Qq0skiWHu6e-V4g?pwd=kn63). Please note that the dataset is undergoing rigorous review and continuous updates to ensure quality and accuracy.

## Medical DeID Model

The code for our baseline medidal DeID model is currently being finalized and will be made available by December 31, 2024.
